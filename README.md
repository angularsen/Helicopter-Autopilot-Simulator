My Master's Thesis project in 2010 at NTNU on developing an autopilot for RC helicopters.

The helicopter acted by simple Newtonian physics for lift and drag and could be flown by autopilot, assisted-autopilot or manually with joystick.
HMD head-tracking was supported via VRPN protocol.
A Kalman filter combined input from virtual GPS, magnetometer and distance sensors to estimate world position.

Requires XNA Game Studio 3.1, Visual Studio 2008.
For headtracking a VRPN server with a head tracking system is required.
