  abstract = {{S}ince grass is very abundant on the {E}arth's surface, it is an
	important element of natural 3{D} scenes. {R}eal-time realistic rendering
	of grass has always been difficult due to the huge number of grass
	blades. {O}vercoming this geometric complexity usually requires many
	coarse approximations to provide interactive frame rates. {H}owever,
	the performance comes at the cost of poor lighting quality and lack
	of detail of the grass. {I}n this report, we describe a grass rendering
	technique that allows better lighting and parallax effect while maintaining
	real-time performance. {W}e use a novel combination of geometry and
	lit volume slices, composed of {B}idirectional {T}exture {F}unctions
	({{BTF}}s). {{BTF}}s, generated using a fast pre-computation step,
	provide an accurate, per pixel lighting of the grass. {O}ur implementation
	allows the rendering of a football field, covered by approximately
	$627$ million virtual grass blades, with dynamic lighting, shadows
	and anti-aliasing in real-time. {T}he creation of arbitrary shaped
	patches of grass is made possible using our density management.},
