You'll have to build individually in sim, imuviewer, downlink/ground/src
and onboard/rev2 for now.  Eventually we'll merge all of them.
For Win32 builds, you will have to copy the Makefile.W32 over top
of Makefile in most every directory.

Please sign up for the autopilot-devel mailing list if you have
any problems building things:

The onboard software supports the new Rev 2.4 boards from Rotomotion:
