This directory contains the software for the onboard computer and
microcontroller.  Right now the onboard computer has not been
designed, so the groundstation code (in the efis repository) talks
directly to the real-time microcontroller.

All microcontroller code is in the ./avr directory.

GNU software is available from these sites:

	http://www.gnu.org/server/list-mirrors.html

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Required software:

binutils-2.11.2
	ftp://ftp.twtelecom.net/pub/GNU/binutils/binutils-2.11.2.tar.gz

	Build with:

		./configure			\
			--target=avr		\
			--prefix=/usr/local
		make
		make install

gcc-core-3.0.1
	ftp://ftp.twtelecom.net/pub/GNU/gcc/gcc-3.0.3/gcc-core-3.0.3.tar.gz

	Build with:

		./configure			\
			--target=avr		\
			--prefix=/usr/local	\
			--enable-language=c
		make
		make install

avr-libc for the AVR:
	http://www.amelek.gda.pl/avr/libc/
	We're using release 20011007, but have also tested with 20011208.
	Build with:

		make
		make install


UISP (In System programmer) for the AVR:
	http://www.amelek.gda.pl/avr/uisp/
	We're using release 20011006

	It's a pain to build with less than 2.4 kernels.
	And it's in C++, which makes it unportable.  There is a binary
	in the source tree, but it doesn't work very well for most
	anyone else.

Todo for Rev 1.1 of the Board:


Size issues:
- Thinner headers.  These require grinding to fit
- Larger holes for accelerometer (done).
- Spacing between AVR and MAX231 is tight if socket is used for MAX231.
- Spacing with DB9F is very tight.  Requires grinding the DB9F. (Done)
- Thinner (0.25) traces are ok for digital lines.  0.30 is just huge.
- "Cut throughs" between pins only on top-side.  None on solder side (done).
- Reduce the number of "expansion holes" and spread out the components.

Style:
- Bi-color LED for power / programming
- Status LED for accelerometer/gyros
- Opto-isolate digital inputs
- Voltage regulator
- Remove jumper for Pitch/Roll accelerometer
- Make two-axis version usable with one gyro + one accelerometer
- Expose all extra lines from gyros and accelerometers
- Solder points for IO lines (done).
- Voltage regulator
- Divide-by-n chips for tachs
- Label servo connectors

Oops:
- MAX231 pinout is totally hosed (Fixed).
- Z / Roll accelerometer pins are backwards and must to be used for
  Pitch/Roll instead.  No room for safety pilot PAL that way. (Fixed)
- Va, Vr and Vcc links are difficult to reach (but should go away)
- If Pitch/Roll accelerometer is used as designed it blocks the
  voltage regulator spot.

Maybe:
- Explore MSP1005-ND from MSI (three axis accelerometer)
- Explore Tokin/Murata ceramic gyros
- Use two-uart AVR and connect GPS to IMU
- Screw-down wire headers for analog/digital inputs

Servo assignments:

These are for both prototypes, the LMH and the 60.  The color refers
to the zip tie on the servo connector; your milage may vary.

	60		LMH		Color
0:	LR Cyclic			Red
1:	FA Cyclic			Green
2:	Throttle or Collective		Yellow
3:	Tail rotor			None
4:	Throttle			Clear
