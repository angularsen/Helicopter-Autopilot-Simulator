ERRATA:

LM7805 spacing is bad; you have to bend the pins as shown in the
picture to get it to fit.

No transistor is supplied.  5808 or equivilant is required.

Servo power supply is bad.  Cut trace on top and on bottom.
Connect to hole underneath AVR with jumper wire.

1/2 W resistors are large.  You might want to substitute 1/4W ones
from RadioShack.

Roll and Pitch accelerometer inputs into ADC on silkscreen are
transposed.  A4 is Pitch, A5 is Roll.

+7V power connector has limited space due to gyro.  It is also
non-polarized so a reverse connection is possible.  The silk
screen label is correct.

No LEDs are supplied.  Use 3mm ones from Radio Shack.

No potentiometer is supplied.  Use an appropriate one based on your
installation of the LCD.
