After lugging laptops, joysticks, helicopters, starting hardware,
jumper cables, etc just to try flying the prototypes, we've decided
that a field box is required.

It would have the following features:

- Gell-cell 12V battery
- 12V charger
- Power inverter
- Weather-proof 12V outlets
- Weather-proof 110 AC outlets
- Posts for 12V "jumper" cables (for starter motor)
- A tool box
- Chargers for the Tx, Rx, glow starter,
- Charger for the 12V battery (from 110 AC)
- Ammeter for 12V current draw
- Fuel tank
- Fuel pump
- Starter holder
- Kill switch
- Protected, weatherproof switches for all functions

Optionally, it would also have room for the helicopter.  This would
greatly increase the size of the case for the .60 sized airframe
and might be too large.  I tried a 36 x 18 x 14 rolling box from
the Container Store and found that just the "pod" of the large
prototype would fit.  The boom was too long, even when detached.

The gel cell battery is required to prevent the electrolyte from
leaking and damaging the other hardware.  If the box were always
oriented correctly, this would not be required.  But since it
would be nice to have wheels on one end (like a roll behind
cart) this is not feasible.  One of the easiest solutions is to
purchase a "Power Pack" from WalMart/Target/etc.  These are self
contained jumpstarting solutions for automobiles; they contain a
sealed gel cell (AGM actually) battery, a trickle charger and
jumper cables.  Throw away the jumper cables, remove it from the
bogus case and it is a perfect 12V source for the field box.

The inverter does not need to be large; it would really only power
the laptop and possibly a small television.  Plus a host of wall-wart
adapters, but not very much overall current.  I've selected a 175
watt (360 peak) unit with no fan; the fan is nice for cooling, but
adds quite a bit of noise.

All of the controls and ports should be accesible from the front panel.
This will involve drilling some holes in the box.
