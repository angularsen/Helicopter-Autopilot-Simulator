PID Control loop details:

P: Proportional response to current offset from desired state

P = E * G + k

E is the difference between where we want to be and where we are.
E = Measurement - Setpoint

G is the gain

Requires manual reset to maintain zero offset from desired position.

--------------

I: Integral response (or automatic reset)

I = g * Kr * Integral of error

g is the gain, Kr is the reset setting in repeats per minute?
Set error to zero and measurement to setpoint.  Make a change
in the input and note the immediate change in the output.

--------------

D: Derivative response

Used to overcome lag in measurements.  Ideal with helicopters.
Also called Pre-Act or Rate.

D = g * Kd * de/dt

g is the gain, Kd is the derivative setting in minutes.

--------------

Input  The process input, in percent
InputD Process input after derivative calculation
InputLast Process input on the previous pass
InputDF Input after derivative calculation and filter
Feedback internal feedback for reset after filter
Derivative Derivative time in minutes
Gain Gain, negative if controller is reverse acting
ResetRate Reset Rate in repeats per minute
DFilter Derivative filter time constants, in minutes
OutputTemp Result of the PID calculation
Output The final output

The PID emulation code:

InputD=Input+(Input-InputLast)*Derivative *60           Derivative calculation
InputLast=Input
InputDF=InputDF+(InputD-InputDF)*DFilter/60              Derivative filter
OutputTemp=(InputDF-SetPoint)*Gain+Feedback              Basic gain calculation
IF OutputTemp >100 THEN OutputTemp= 100                        Output Limits
IF OutputTemp <0 THEN OutputTemp= 0                                         Values other than 0 and 100 may be used
Output=OutputTemp                                                                               The final output
Feedback=Feedback+(Feedback-Output)*ResetRate/60 Filter for reset feedback
