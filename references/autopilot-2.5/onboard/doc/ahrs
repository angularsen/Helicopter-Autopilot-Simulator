From the gyro we receive rate of pitch and rate of roll information.
From the accelerometer we receive "tilt" relative to the resultant
force on the sensor.  Let's look at some sample cases to see how
these values can be confusing:

Level:
- Roll = 0
- Pitch = 0
- X = 0
- Y = 0

Banked (coordinated)
- Roll = 0
- Pitch = 0
- X = 0
- Y = 0

How do we tell these apart?  By the roll-in to the coordinated bank.


	Level	Starting roll	Rolling	Stopping roll	Banked
Roll	0	10		0	-10		0
Pitch	0	0		0	0		0
X	0	0		0	0		0
Y	0	0		0	0		0
