The ADXL202 and ADXL210 output pulse width modulated ("duty cycle")
data that represents the acceleration along that axis.  These are
two axis units, so they can be used for tilt sensors.

Similar to the hobby gyros, the measurement of the pulse widths
must be rock-solid to ensure that the signal does not jitter.
The easiest way to do this is to concentrate all the time on it,
but we want the board to do other things, too.

A sample pulse train for one axis:

  v------------------- T2 ----------------v
   ____________                            _____________
__|            |__________________________|             |___________

  ^---- T1 ----^

The acceleration along this axis is A(g) = (T1/T2 - 0.5) / k
For the ADXL202 units, k = 0.125 g
For the ADXl210 units, k = 0.500 g

That means that if the sensor is subject to no force (0g), the T1
pulse width will be 50% of the T2 width.  Subject to gravity,
A = 1g -> T1 / T2 = 0.625.

Unfortunately, the midpoints of the two axis pulses coincide
rather than the start or end times.
             ___________                ___________
X   ________|           |______________|           |____
            ^ Ta        ^ Tb
               _______                    _______
Y   __________|       |__________________|       |______
                                         ^ Tc    ^ Td

This makes measuring the two widths simulatenously difficult.
Analog provides a tech note on the subject, with sample code:

	http://www.analog.com/techsupt/application_notes/202Duty.pdf

We reproduce details of that note here and in the code.

Ta = Rising edge of X
Tb = Falling edge of X
Tc = Rising edge of Y
Td = Falling edge of Y

T1x = Tb - Ta
T1y = Td - Tc
T2x = T2y = Tc + (Td - Tc)/2 - (Ta + (Tb - Ta) / 2)
2 T2 = 2 Tc + Td - Tc - 2 Ta - Tb + Ta
     = Tc + Td - Ta - Tb

To avoid overflow on the 16-bit words, we compute it thusly:

T3 = 2 T2 = (Td - Tb) + (Tc - Ta)

We keep track of 2 T2 rather than T2 and deduce new constants:

Ax = (T1x / T2 - 0.5) / k
   = T1x / (k T2) - 0.5 / k
   = T1x / (k1 T3) - k2

where k1 = k / 2 and k2 = 0.5 / k

Since we have selected a resistor that gives us roughly 10ms for T2,
we can compute that we have between 2.5 ms and 7.5 ms after marking
Ta and Tc.  And a like amount between Tb and Tc.  We can squeeze
some computation or IO in that period.

Our sampling cycle is roughly 50 Hz.  We want to update the servos that
frequently, so this should work well.  We're currently sampling it in
the code and things are working great.

For the actual IMU we will require a second ADXL202 or 210.  This
means that the IMU will measure one axes with two accelerometers.
But we don't have to listen to the extra accelerometer and probably
don't want to.  If we have two ADXL202's, the four sets of pulses
are not going to be syncronized.  This means that we'll end up
sampling the two waveforms separately and halving the bandwidth
available.

Can we make do with only two axis measured by the accelerometers?
Perhaps, since in hovering flight we should be able to use them as
tilt sensors.  The problem comes in a banking turn, where the forces
look like this:

         ______
	|      |
        |      |
        |______|
       /        \
      /     |    \
     /      |     \
   mg       |     mv^2 / r
            |
            v
           F=ma

You have to imagine the box is tilted on its side at an angle A off
the vertical axis.  I can't do it in ASCII very well.

We have the force downward of mg.  We have the acceleration
outward of mv^2/r = mf.  The resultant force is

	|F| = m sqrt( g^2 + v^4 / r^2 )
	 a  =   sqrt( g^2 + f^2 )

at an angle

	/_ = atan( f / g )

In a coordinated turn, /_ = 90 - A which means that the force is
straight down through the floor of the aircraft.  We can
plug in some values for different bank angles, but the one that is
easy is A = 60 degrees.

	/_ = 30 = atan( g / f )
	tan(30) = sqrt(3) = g / f
	f = sqrt(3) g

Where f is the outward force.  Thus, the resultant acceleration magnitude is

	a = sqrt( g^2 + f^2 )
	  = sqrt( g^2 + (sqrt(3) g)^2 )
	  = sqrt( g^2 + 3 g^2 )
	  = sqrt( 4 g^2 )
	  = 2 g

The tilt and roll accelerometers will read zero acceleration and might
lead us to conclude that the aircraft is level.  However, the vertical
accelerometer will tell us that it is experiencing a 2 g force.
Either we are rapidly climbing in a level attitude, or we are in
a constant banked coordinated turn.  Without the third accelerometer
we could not tell that we were off level at all.

Would the rate gyros help us?  Maybe.  I haven't started correlating
the inputs yet.
